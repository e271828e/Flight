In a spark ignition engine, manifold air pressure (MAP) is a function of RPM, throttle position and air density:
$$MAP = MAP(n, thr, \rho)$$

Brake power is a function of $RPM$, $MAP$, and air density:
$$P = P(n, MAP, \rho) = P(n, MAP(n, thr, \rho), \rho) = P(n, thr, \rho)$$

For ISA sea level conditions, we can define:
<!-- $$MAP_{sl} = MAP(n, thr, \rho_{sl}) =  MAP_{sl}(n, thr) -->
$$P_{sl} = P(n, MAP, \rho_{sl}) = P_{sl}(n, MAP)$$

This function is shown on Figure 3-21 (Left), with $MAP$ on the x axis and $P$ on the y axis, for different values of $n$.

<!-- At SL conditions, the $MAP$ for each throttle setting has specific limits -->

For $thr = 1$ (full throttle) we have:
$$MAP_{full} = MAP(n, 1, \rho)= MAP_{full}(n, \rho)$$

That is, for each $n$, the full throttle $MAP$ value is determined by air density. This relation between full throttle $MAP$ and $\rho$ is one-to-one. Therefore, it can be inverted to yield the following function:

$$\rho_{full} = \rho_{full}(n, MAP)$$

Thus, for each $n$ there is a density value $\rho_{full}$ for which a given $MAP$ value is the full throttle $MAP$, which we denoted $MAP_full$.

Because $\rho$ is a function of (geopotential) altitude, there is an equivalent relation:
$$h_{full} = h_{full}(n, MAP)$$

We can also define:
$$P_{full}(n, MAP) = P(n, MAP, \rho_{full}(n, MAP))$$

This is the power output of the engine at a given $n$ and $MAP$ when it is operated at full throttle, that is, when that $MAP$ is the full throttle $MAP$. This occurs at an air density given by $\rho_{full}$

Both $h_{full}(n, MAP)$ and $P_{full}(n, \rho)$ are provided by Figure 3-21 (Right).

For ISA conditions, pressure altitude and geopotential altitude are equivalent. Therefore, the $\rho$ values corresponding to the $h$ values in the figure can be obtained directly by evaluating the ISA model for those values and standard sea level conditions.

Our goal is to compute $P(n, MAP, \rho)$ for the general case. For this, we can write:
$$P(n, MAP, \rho) \approx P(n, MAP, \rho_{sl}) + \left.\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\right|_{n,MAP,\rho_{sl}}(\rho - \rho_{sl})$$

The first term is directly available from the left figure.

For the second term, we can estimate the derivative at $\rho_sl$ as:
$$\left.\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\right|_{n,MAP,\rho_{sl}}\approx \frac{P_{ref}(n,MAP) - P(n,MAP,\rho_{sl})}{\rho_{ref} - \rho_{sl}}$$

Where $\rho_{ref}$ denotes some arbitrary density and $P_{ref}(n,MAP)$ is the corresponding power output.

We can choose $\rho_{ref} = \rho_{full}(n, MAP)$, that is, a density such that $MAP$ is the full throttle $MAP$. In that case, the power output $P_{ref}(n,MAP)$ must be:

$$P_{ref}(n,MAP) = P(n, MAP, \rho_{full}(n, MAP)) = P_{full}(n,MAP)$$

Both $\rho_{full}$ and $P_{full}$ can be obtained from Figure 3-21 (Right)

The right figure assumes a temperature variation with $\rho$ (or $h$) corresponding to an ISA model. Thus, the $P(n, MAP, \rho)$ obtained so far must be corrected as follows:
$$P_{corr} = P \sqrt{\dfrac{T_{ISA}}{T}}$$

Where $T_{ISA}$ is the temperature corresponding to the actual $\rho$ (or $h$) for ISA conditions, and $T$ is the actual temperature. We can compute $T_{ISA}$ by evaluating the ISA model with our current geopotential altitude and standard sea level conditions:
ISAData(AltGeop(kinematics.pos.h_orth), SLConditions())

Figure 3-21 assumes maximum power mixture ($mix = 1$). We can use the ratios in figure 3-1 to scale down the power output for $mix \in [0,1]$.

Figure 3-5 provides fuel consumption as:
$$\dot{m} = \dot{m}(n,P,mix)$$


To model any fuel injected piston engine in the Lycoming lineup, for example IO-540, non-dimensionalize:
- Power values in Figure 3-21 with rated power
- Fuel consumption in figure 3-5 with fuel consumption at rated power with maximum power mixture.
