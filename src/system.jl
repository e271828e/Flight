#this method is free to modify the system's discrete state, control inputs and

#otherwise. it is dangerous to provide a default fallback for f_disc!, because
#if the intended f_disc! implementation for the System has the wrong interface,
#the dispatch will revert to the fallback, which may not be obvious at all. it
#is safer to force each concrete System that does not require an actual f_disc!
#to implement a trivial f_disc! that returns false

#the AbstractSystem requires defining at least a continuous state vector, which
#should be a ComponentVector returned by method X. to main reasons:
#1) DifferentialEquations seems to fail when the state vector is an array of
#   Union{Float64, Missing}. on the other hand, since the input and output
#   vectors are parameters from the integrator's perspective, it does not handle
#   them explicitly and they are no problem.
#2) If a continuous dynamical system has no continuous states, it is not a
#   continuous dynamical system, so it should not be defined at such. if it is
#   part of a parent system which does have states, it can be handled within the
#   parent System.
