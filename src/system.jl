#the AbstractSystem requires defining at least a continuous state vector, which
#should be a ComponentVector returned by method X. to main reasons:
#1) DifferentialEquations seems to fail when the state vector is an array of
#   Union{Float64, Missing}. on the other hand, since the input and output
#   vectors are parameters from the integrator's perspective, it does not handle
#   them explicitly and they are no problem.
#2) If a continuous dynamical system has no continuous states, it is not a
#   continuous dynamical system, so it should not be defined at such. if it is
#   part of a parent system which does have states, it can be handled within the
#   parent System.

#an output vector is also required, because:
#1) Dealing with Union{Float64,Missing} is slower for some methods used by
#   Kinematics and Dynamics (RQuat() for example)
#2) A continuous dynamical system should have some observable output. if nothing
#   else, the state itself
#this should return true if x was modified, false otherwise.

# it is dangerous to provide a default fallback for f_disc!, because if the
#intended f_disc! implementation for the System has the wrong interface, the
#dispatch will revert to the fallback, which may not be obvious at all. it is
#safer to force each concrete System that does not require an actual f_disc! to
#implement a trivial f_disc! that returns false

# #replace this with the appropriate overloads, Plot recipes, whatever
# plotlog(log, sys::AbstractSystem) = extend_error(S)
