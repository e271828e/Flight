    #we must provide:
    #radial chord distribution (from ζ = 0 to ζ = 1)
    #radial pitch distribution
    #airfoil zero-lift angle
    #airfoil 2D C_L and C_D
    #propeller radius
    #number of blades

    #we assume we have already computed v_wOc_c
    #we set ω_cs


    #the number of blades affects the total blade section circulation at a given
    #radial distance in the Goldstein's condition, and therefore the more blades
    #we have, the larger the induced velocity will be, and the less efficiency
    #is to be gained from adding further blades

    k = 2 #number of blades
    K
    ζ_h

    #airfoil characteristics: C_L(α), C_L_α(α), C_D(α)
